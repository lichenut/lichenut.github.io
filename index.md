# <i class="fa fa-feather-alt fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;About Me

I received my Ph.D. and M.A.Sc. degrees from University of Toronto in 2018 and 2015, respectively, and my Bachelor degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2012. I visited the Hong Kong Polytechnic University from September 2013 to May 2014.

My research interests include deep learning systems, federated learning, cloud computing, networking, resource optimization and fairness.
