# <i class="fa fa-feather-alt fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;About Me

I received my Ph.D. and M.A.Sc. degrees from University of Toronto in 2018 and 2015, respectively, and my Bachelor degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2012. I visited the Hong Kong Polytechnic University from September 2013 to May 2014.

My research interests include deep learning systems, federated learning, cloud computing, networking, resource optimization and fairness.

# <i class="fa fa-layer-group fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;Research Lab

I am directing the research lab, named ***CELESTIAL***: **C**ommunication **E**fficient **LE**arning **S**ystems – **T**he **I**mplementation and **A**lgorithms **L**ab.
As the name suggests, we are interested in exploring important problems in distributed systems and networking to better facilitate machine learning and drive artificial intelligence, from both the theoretical and practical perspectives. 

Our lab members [(Gallery)](/group/):

**Jananie Jarachanthan**, **Abeda Sultana**, **Md Mainul Haque**, **Simin Javaherian**, **Pinky Sitikhu**

Dr. **Jiao Li** from Xi'an Shiyou University has been in our lab as a visiting scholar from September 2019 to August 2020.

I'm lucky to work with our group members.
