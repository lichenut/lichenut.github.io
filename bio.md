Li is currently an Associate Professor at the School of Computing and Informatics, University of Louisiana at Lafayette. She received her Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto in 2018, after six years of graduate study in the [iQua research group](http://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/index.html) under the supervision of Prof. [Baochun Li](http://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/bli/index.html), where she also received her M.A.Sc. degree in January 2015. She visited the Hong Kong Polytechnic University from 2013 to 2014 for 8 months. In July 2012, she received her B.Eng degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

During her graduate years in iQua, Li has studied interesting research problems related to resource allocation and performance optimization in the era of cloud computing and machine learning, with the constraints of fairness. She is interested in applying theoretical tools to study real problems and deriving insights to guide the design of a practical system. She won the award of

During her undergraduate years, Li achieved excellent academic performance, especially in courses of mathematics and major fundamentals, ranking the top 3% among four hundred students. In the summer of 2011, she received an opportunity to take an internship at Baidu, Inc. in Beijing, the largest search engine provider in China. In her final year, she joined the research group of “Cloud Datacenter & Green Computing/Communications” in her university, actively involved in the thesis project of analyzing the tradeoff between power and performance in datacenter networks. She also took some volunteer work such as organizing scientific lectures.
